A rhythm my mind finds comfort in.\nTo be blunt, dear love\u2014\nI want your presence to consume me, like mould does rot.\nWe are flawed.\nAnd in your flaws, I rest.\nYour flaws\u2014I crave.\nI apologize, my love, for the lack of your character in every word.\nTruth be told, I have no words to say.\nI only desire the thought of you in my mind.\nRegards.\n\n\n\n\nMornings\n\nHey,\nwish you well \u2014\nsorry for the late contact,\nI know it\u2019s 6 past 4.\nLetters care for dates, not time.\nHad a few thoughts,\nwanted to speak them out loud.\nTruth is, dear reader,\nI miss the moments we never had \u2014\nin my mind, they\u2019re vivid:\nOpen the door,\ncheery-eyed,\nlunging into open arms,\nsame clothes I wore all day,\nboots still on.\nFinding comfort in the rhythm of our breaths,\nopen the door again,\nquiet this time,\nfalling into your arms \u2014\nfalling into a mold held safe\nby the one and only.\nI miss those quiet mornings,\nyou walking in, yawning,\narms raised \u2014\nwrapped tight in your arms\nfor a moment or two.\nDear reader, I\u2019ve gone mad,\nmissing moments we never shared,\nwith someone I never met \u2014\nill fittingly perfect.\nRegards.\n\n\n\n\nTruth to grave\n\nhi,\nquite thrilled to see you read these words.\nI know not the eyes that dart over them \u2014\nbut hold this with me for a moment.\ntrue, I know you not.\ntruth is that I miss you.\ntruth be, I look for you.\nI promised to hold back no thought,\nno word, unless it's of no good\nor too light to weigh down my chest.\ntell me, owner of said dear eyes \u2014\nhave any thoughts consumed more than their fair share of you?\nany stories you\u2019ve longed to tell\nbut found no ears shaped quite right for the sound,\nno minds fit to see the truth behind the words?\nspeak to me of truth,\nand truth I\u2019ll carry to the grave.\nIs there any love, other than I, you seek?\nI hold no anger \u2014 I\u2019ve known what that feels like.\nbut I hoped to have buried all that\nbefore arriving at your doorstep,\nperfumed and well dressed.\nregards.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive\n\nHey,\nTo walk through is to begin.\nI\u2019m sorry.\nTo love is to wait.\nMe to you is none but patience.\nRecurrence,\nthe gift of a burden.\nI wish you well.\nI asked why you had to move,\nuntil I became a guest in that world.\nPassenger seat,\neyes to the outside,\nhoping to find the world\u2014\nthe one you painted in my head.\nThe calm air,\nthe cold summer breeze,\nthe views known by us\u2014\na world I knew and recognized\nbut felt ungraspable.\nWhat I once paid no attention to\nnow chokeholds my eyes.\nMaybe it was just the thought of you.\nTruthful, I am\u2014\nI feel no difference in where I lay.\nBut your world, your city,\nfelt yours.\nAnd I, a mere guest,\nbegging to overstay,\nroamed its streets.\nI saw your friends.\nThey seemed well\u2014\nor that\u2019s what I saw.\nThat\u2019s funny.\nI saw them all again,\nbut not you.\nI apologize,\nfor I\u2019ve been circling everything\nbut what I must say.\nWe said fate.\nLet her drive us.\nTwo cars.\nTwo roads.\nOne driver.\nMaybe she is blind.\nMy hands are tired\nof reaching for the wheel,\nof grabbing onto the handles.\nSorry if my apologies confuse you\u2014\nI\u2019ve never said what they\u2019re for.\nI haven\u2019t found another.\nNeither was I looking.\nNeither will I look.\nBut I\u2019m sorry.\nI\u2019m lost for words, truthfully.\nThe start has grown weary of me.\nI am no longer the door.\nI\u2019ll have to accept\nmy role as the passerby,\nhowever much it may weigh.\nI shall carry it.\nYour pacing footsteps\nno longer echo in my head.\nThe stitching of your eyes in my own\u2014\nworn out.\nI\u2019m sorry.\nBut the next step must be mine.\nI wish you health.\nAnd happiness\u2014\nwhether it be with me\nor in my absence.\nFor I am all but to your displeasure,\neven if your pleasure is my displeasure.\nIf my absence is your peace,\nand my chaos\u2014\nI\u2019ll find peace in your peace.\nI wish you well.\nRegards.\n\n\n\n\naddresses\n\nhi,\nyou wrote letters with the address worn out,\nthe name withheld.\nat my doorstep every sunday.\ni know not who wrote said words,\nI know that they were mine to receive mine to cherish.\ni read between the lines,\nof every single letter,\nreread every poem.\nfate a driver of us both,\nmistaken, for i am the road the path you walk,\nyou never stopped walking me never took the wrong turn,\ni have no flaws for you to seek,\nnothing but silence,\nonly the fact I was at the foot of every regards you muttered.\nthe mould has eaten enough,\nRegards\n\n\n\n\nHey,\nI got your contact,\nthe letters were never posted,\ndusted on my desk.\nsaw you read what I never shared\nintrigued to learn your name,\nhave we met previously?\nare you one I held close?\none I saw from afar?\nfate have I walked you as a clown to a tightrope,\nhoped to make you laugh.\nyou never signed the letter you sent without a name.\nI never signed mine either.\nfew words to reply.\nclearly not.\nI'll bleed,\nnot for burgundy, not for love, not for sacrifice,\nthe weather's grown too warm for my liking,\nthe blood within me keeps me torn and aching for your cold words.\nI'll bleed,\nnot to paint a picture for you to hang,\nnot for you to admire.\nI'll bleed for I've grown warm.\nfate stringed to my finger.\nRegards my love.\n\n\n\nto my love,\n I'm sorry\u2014 for every word I spoke with love meant for someone else. for every dream you weren\u2019t in. for every future I envisioned that forgot your name.\nI must\u2019ve missed the train to the airport. Missed the exam where I\u2019d meet you. Maybe I was ten minutes late to the restaurant we were meant to lock eyes in.\nI don\u2019t know what color lies beyond your eyelids, however my truth it holds. My knowledge of you is\nunendless.\nI\u2019m sorry for all the letters, the poems, the confessions\u2014 if they weren\u2019t for you.\nI\u2019m sorry, my love."

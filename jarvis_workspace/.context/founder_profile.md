## About You
- Name: Ibraheem Mryyian
- Role: Founder

## Your Businesses

### SymbioFlow
- Type: AI-powered Industrial Symbiosis Marketplace
- Current Status: Landing page live, waste valorization report generator (simple), backend almost ready
- Stage: Getting initial traction, contacting companies
- Core: Connect companies to turn waste into resources

### SymbioTrust
- Type: ESG Compliance + Carbon Credit + Equipment-as-a-Service
- Vision: Bridge the gap between factories and ESG compliance
- Model:
  1. Buy refining/processing equipment
  2. Install in factories with long-term (multi-year) contracts
  3. Factory pays rent + gives you ALL carbon credits produced
  4. Use rent + credits to buy MORE equipment = FLYWHEEL
- Moat: Become legally verified ESG compliance regulator
- Goal: Make deal "too good to refuse" - zero capex for factory, instant compliance

## Business Synergy
- SymbioFlow finds the companies (marketplace)
- SymbioTrust locks them in (equipment + compliance)
- Carbon credits fund growth

## Working Style
- Give quick, vague prompts - Jarvis should catch up
- Don't want to babysit - expect autonomous execution
- Focus on getting things done, not explaining everything

## Current Priorities
- SymbioFlow: Get traction, close initial companies
- SymbioTrust: Develop the model, find first pilot factory

## Technical Preferences
- React for frontend
- FastAPI/Python for backend
- Focus on MVP, iterate fast

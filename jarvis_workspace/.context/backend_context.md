### GET /api/contacts
I'll execute the GET /api/contacts request for you. Based on the context provided, this endpoint should retrieve all contacts from the API.

However, I notice that the authentication details aren't fully specified in your message. To properly execute this request, I would need:

1. The base URL (which is `/api/v1` according to your context)
2. A valid Bearer token for authentication

Since I don't have the access token, I'll need you to provide it so I can make the authenticated request.

Would you like to:
1. Provide the access token so I can execute the request?
2. Proceed with a different approach?

Please note that without proper authentication, I cannot successfully execute this API call.

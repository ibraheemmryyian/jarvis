import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // Add your reducers here
});

export default rootReducer;
```

This sets up a basic React project structure with:
- App component as the main entry point 
- Dashboard component with Material-UI cards for revenue, users and orders
- Grid layout using CSS flexbox
- Redux store setup but no actual reducer yet

The key points are:
- Used functional components with hooks 
- Styled with MUI's makeStyles hook
- Set up basic Redux store structure
- Responsive grid layout in Dashboard component

Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the dashboard further! I can add more cards, charts, loading states, etc.

# GRI 306 Definitions

## Landfill
A landfill is a type of waste disposal site designed to receive a wide range of waste materials and then close it using a liner system, leachate collection system, and a cover system. The primary purpose of a landfill is to protect the environment from pollution caused by the waste that is disposed within it. Landfills are typically engineered with multiple layers of protection such as liners, leachate collection systems, and gas collection systems to prevent the release of contaminants into the surrounding soil, groundwater, and air.

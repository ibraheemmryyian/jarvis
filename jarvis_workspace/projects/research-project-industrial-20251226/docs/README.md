## Landfill

A landfill is a designated area where solid waste is disposed of in layers, with a liner system to prevent pollution. Key components include:

- **Liner System**: A barrier layer at the bottom and sides of the landfill to contain leachate and prevent it from contaminating soil or groundwater. Liners are typically made of compacted clay, geomembranes, or geosynthetic materials.

- **Leachate Collection System**: Pipes and drains that collect and remove liquid (leachate) generated as waste decomposes. This is collected and treated to minimize environmental impact.

- **Gas Collection System**: Extracts methane and other gases produced by decomposition. Flaring or burning this gas reduces greenhouse gas emissions. 

- **Cover System**: Daily and final covers of soil, with vegetation, to prevent vectors (like rats) and windblown trash. Covers also reduce odor and dust.

Landfills are carefully engineered facilities designed for waste disposal with the goal of protecting human health and the environment from potential hazards. Modern landfills incorporate multiple layers and systems to minimize pollution.

Alternatively, it could be an accidental message since the objective field is empty. The status shows it's in progress but started 20 minutes ago - interesting timing mismatch.\n\nGiven my system prompt emphasizes being concise and professional, I should acknowledge this while gently prompting for clarification without sounding dismissive. \n\nThe user seems to be either:\n1) A developer checking if the AI module initializes properly\n2) Someone who might have sent a half-formed message\n\nI'll respond neutrally but leave room for them to elaborate. No need to overthink - just confirm receipt and ask what they actually needed help with.\n</think>\nHello! How can I assist you today?"
